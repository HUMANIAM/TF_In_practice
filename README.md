# Tensorflow Developer Professional Certificate
This a specialization on coursera teaches us how to use TF to create models that learn from data.  
How to use TF in Computer vision, NLP, time series data, and show you how the TF can help you to `define->compile->fit->eveluate` your models in very short time.

## Motivation
After finishing Ng's ML course and DL specialization and learning some statistics, probability, linear algebra, calcus. I want to learn some ML frameworks to implement/expriment quickly ideas and play with the data using NN technique.

## Content
- [introduction to tensorflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow)
    * learning about tensorflow basics like how to define a model, compile it, evaluate it.
- [tensorflow with CV](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)
    * learning about how to solve the overfitting problem using `Data Augmentation`, `transfer learning`, and `regularization`.
    * feature maps visualization.
    * flowing data from directory and from numpy arrays. 
- [tensorflow with NLP](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow)
    * learning about tokenization and sequence padding.
